                    </center>
		    <div>
  			<p><b>Micro</b> is a globally distributed technology company on a mission to 
			become the simplest way to develop, share and collaborate on services. We're doing this with a  
			<b>developer first focus</b>.</p>

			<br>
			<h4><b>The Challenge</b></h4>

			<p>Change is afoot. We're quickly moving towards a world driven entirely by technology.
			Every organisation at the heart of it's business must now become a technology company. 
			Maintaining a competitive edge in this day and age is 
			becoming increasingly difficult. An organisation's ability to execute can grind to a halt as they 
			try to scale with inefficient platforms, processes and structure. Decade old technology 
			companies have undergone these scaling pains and most have used the same methods 
			to overcome those challenges.</p>

			<p>Something has to change. We all need help adapting in this new world. It's time to bring 
			the competitive advantages of the most successful technology companies to the rest of the world.</p>

			<p>So let's talk about their secrets, their competitive edge. <b>Microservices</b>.</p>

			<br>
			<h4><b>The Philosophy</b></h4>

			<p>Microservices is a software design pattern used to breakdown large monolithic applications 
			into smaller manageable independent services which communicate over networks via 
			language agnostic protocols, each focusing on doing one thing well.</p>

			<p>The concept of microservices is not new, this is the reimagining of service oriented architecture 
			but with an approach more holistically aligned with unix processes and pipes.</p>

			<br>
			<h6><b>The philosophy of microservices:</b></h6>
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Services are small</b> - fine-grained as a singular business purpose similar to unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well"</li><br>
			<li>The organization culture should <b>embrace automation</b> of deployment and testing. This eases the burden on management and operations</li><br>
			<li>The culture and design principles should <b>embrace failure and faults</b>, similar to anti-fragile systems.</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<h6><b>Industry definitions of microservices:</b></h6>
			
			<blockquote>
			<p><br>Loosely coupled service oriented architecture with a bounded context</p>
			<footer class="blockquote-footer">Adrian Cockcroft</footer>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
			<p><br>An approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, 
			each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms</p>
			<footer class="blockquote-footer">Martin Fowler</footer>
			</blockquote>

			<br>
			<h4><b>The Strategy</b></h4>

			<p>As organisations scale both technology and head count it becomes much more difficult to manage monolithic 
			code bases. We all became accustomed to the Twitter fail whale for a period of time as they attempted to 
			scale their user base and product feature set with a monolithic system.</p>

			<p>Microservices enabled Twitter to 
			decompose their application into smaller services that could be managed separately by many different teams.</p>
			<p>Each team being responsible for a business function composed of many microservices which can be deployed 
			independently from other teams.</p>

			</div>
			<br>
			<p>We've seen through first hand experience that microservice systems enable faster development cycles, 
			improved productivity and superior scalable systems.</p>

			<p>Let's talk about some of the benefits:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>1. <b>Easier to scale development</b> - teams organise around different business requirements and manage their own services.</li>

			<li>2. <b>Easier to understand</b> - microservices are much smaller, usually 1000 LOC or less.

			<li>3. <b>Easier to deploy new versions of services frequently</b> - services can be deployed, scaled and managed independently.</li>

			<li>4. <b>Improved fault tolerance and isolation</b> - separation of concerns minimises the impact of issues in one service from another.</li>

			<li>5. <b>Improved speed of execution</b> - teams deliver on business requirements faster by developing, deploying and managing microservices independently.</li>

			<li>6. <b>Reusable services and rapid prototyping</b> - the unix philosophy ingrained in microservices allow you to reuse existing services and 
			build entirely new functionality on top much quicker.</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<h4><b>The Technology</b></h4>

			<p>Micro is the simplest way to build microservices. We provide a <a href="https://github.com/micro/micro">runtime</a>
			 and <a href="https://github.com/micro/go-micro">framework</a> for microservices 
			development. Enabling innovation in modern software driven enterprises. We plan to be the defacto 
			standard for microservices and will look to empower companies to leverage this technology for their 
			own businesses. From early stage prototyping all the way through to large scale production 
			deployments.</p>

			<p>We've seen a fundamental shift coming in the industry. Moore's law is in effect and we're gaining access 
			to more and more compute power everyday. Yet we're not able to fully realise this new capacity. Existing 
			tools and development practices do not scale in this new era.</p>

			<p>Developers are not being provided the tools 
			to move from monolithic code bases to more efficient design patterns. Most companies inevitably reach a 
			point of diminishing returns with monolithic designs and have to undergo massive R&D reengineering efforts. 
			Netfix, Twitter, Gilt and Hailo are all prime examples of this. All of them ended up building their own microservice 
			platforms.</p>

			<br>
			<h4><b>The Vision</b></h4>

			<p>Our vision is to provide the fundamental building blocks for microservices so anyone can 
			develop and adopt them with ease. We want to empower not only the developers of the world today 
			but also unlock the next billion by providing a vastly simpler experience for service development.
			</p>

			<p>Software development is a largely exclusive demographic with only <b>24m</b> of us in the world today. 
			What if we could change this. What if we could make it so that anyone could build services 
			as easily as they can write text messages, make phone calls or post to instagram.</p>
